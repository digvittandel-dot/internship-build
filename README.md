# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.
The goal is to build a simple yet effective model that can classify transactions as fraud or non-fraud.

## Problem Statement
Credit card fraud causes significant financial losses each year.
By analyzing transaction patterns, we can identify suspicious activities early.

## Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized credit card transaction data.
Each transaction is labeled as:
- 0 → Legitimate
- 1 → Fraudulent

## Approach
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Status
🚧 Project under active development.
