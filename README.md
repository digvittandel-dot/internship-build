# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Logistic Regression.

## Dataset
Public credit card transaction dataset containing anonymized features.
- Class 0 → Legitimate transaction
- Class 1 → Fraudulent transaction

## Approach
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Train-test split
3. Model training using Logistic Regression
4. Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions.
